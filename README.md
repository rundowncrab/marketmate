🚀 Features

🎯 Domain-Specific Scope: Only handles financial queries—market news, stock performance, earnings reports.


🔁 Multi-Chat Session Support: Maintains and switches between multiple conversations using session tracking.


📊 Tiered Rate Limiting: Enforces rate limits (RPM, RPD, TPM, TPD) based on the user's subscription tier.


🔗 Mock API Integration: Simulates realistic financial data via mocked get_financial_news and get_quarterly_results APIs.


🎨 Web UI: Clean, interactive HTML interface with persistent chat history.


🧠 Design Approach

Framework: Built using FastAPI for asynchronous performance and simplicity.


Templating: Jinja2 is used to render a dynamic frontend in site.html.


Sessions: Managed via SessionMiddleware, enabling users to maintain context across messages and chats.


Mock API Calls: Simulated financial data responses help isolate UI/backend logic from external dependencies during early development or offline usage.


Token Estimation: Word count approximates token usage to enforce usage caps.


⚙️ Key Design Decisions

Domain Restriction: All logic enforces financial-only queries to keep scope narrow and consistent.


Session Storage: Session data is stored server-side using cookies for simplicity—sufficient for single-user/local testing.


Rate Limiting Logic: Built-in checks ensure users don't exceed tier-based limits, protecting backend resource usage.


Company Name Extraction: Basic keyword matching (extract_company_name) is used as a placeholder for Named Entity Recognition.

✅ Assumptions Made

Only three companies (Tata, Infosys, Reliance) are recognized in the mock extract_company_name function.


Tier information (like Free, Tier-1, etc.) and user IDs are assumed to be stored in the session.


Token calculation uses a simple len(text.split()), which may not align exactly with OpenAI tokenizers.


🔧 Potential Improvements

⚙️ Authentication System: Add user login, persistent storage, and dynamic tier assignment.


📈 Real API Integration: Replace mocks with live financial APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage).


🧠 NER for Company Extraction: Integrate spaCy or another NLP tool to accurately extract company names from free-text.


📚 Database Integration: Store conversations in a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) instead of session memory.


🌐 Model Flexibility: Add dynamic provider support (e.g., Anthropic, Mistral) with switchable model keys.
